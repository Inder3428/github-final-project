# **Simple Interest Calculator**  

## **Overview**  
This is a basic Python-based calculator that computes simple interest given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.  

## **Formula Used**  
\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]  
Where:  
- **P** = Principal Amount  
- **R** = Annual Rate of Interest (in percentage)  
- **T** = Time Period (in years)  

## **Features**  
- Takes user input for principal amount, interest rate, and time period.  
- Calculates simple interest based on the provided inputs.  
- Outputs the calculated interest amount.  

## **Installation & Requirements**  
No external libraries are needed. This script runs in any Python 3 environment.  

## **Usage**  
1. Clone the repository or download the script.  
2. Run the script using:  
   ```bash
   python simple_interest.py
   ```  
3. Enter the required values when prompted.  
4. View the calculated simple interest.  

## **Example**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter principal amount: 1000  
Enter time period (years): 5  
Enter annual rate of interest: 10  
```  
**Output:**  
```
Simple Interest = 500.0  
```
